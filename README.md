# Thyroid Disease Detection using Machine Learning
---

## Project Objective

To **accurately detect thyroid disorders** (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and normal) using machine learning algorithms on a real-world medical dataset. The project leverages advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and robust model evaluation to improve diagnostic support for healthcare professionals.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using **mean, median, and mode**
- Outlier detection using **3Ïƒ rule and IQR**
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- MinMax scaling for numerical features
- Dropped irrelevant columns: `patient_id`, `TBG`

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of lab values (TSH, T3, TT4, etc.)
- Correlation heatmaps and feature importance
- Data imbalance handled via **stratified splitting**

### Models Trained

| Decision Tree      | 0.9785   | 0.9778    | 0.9785 | 0.9778   |
| KNN                | 0.9147   | 0.9072    | 0.9147 | 0.8984   |
| Random Forest      | 0.9870   | 0.9866    | 0.9870 | 0.9866   |
| Gradient Boosting  | **0.9889** | 0.9889 | 0.9889 | 0.9889   |
| SVM                | 0.8958   | 0.9033    | 0.8958 | 0.8587   |
